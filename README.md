# Mansurs_Shop
A single vendor e-commerce app. This was initially UI design homework by Maan Academy. Later I changed the UI a little and added more functionalities. Working on this project taught me a lot about Flutter. And I was able to experiment with new things on this.

What was used to make this app:
1. Firebase Authentication.
2. Firebase Firestore.
3. Firebase Storage.
4. Stripe payment through card.
5. Provider (State Management).
6. Comments used to make the project understandable.
