# Mansurs_Shop
A single vendor e-commerce app. This was initially UI design homework by Maan Academy. Later I changed the UI a little and added more functionalities. Working on this project taught me a lot about Flutter. And I was able to experiment with new things on this. 

What was used to make this app:
1. MVVM Architecture was used to keep the code clean and maintainable.
2. Firebase Authentication.
3. Firebase Firestore.
4. Firebase Storage.
5. Stripe payment through card.
6. Provider (State Management).
7. Comments used to make the project understandable.
